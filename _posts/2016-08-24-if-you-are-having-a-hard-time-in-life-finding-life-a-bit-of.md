If you are having a hard time in life, finding life a bit of a grind, hating your job, lacking fulfilment, not doing well in your relationship, perhaps even dealing with depression or some sort of serious mood disorder, it's probably time to look at what the root cause might be. What is causing all this angst and difficulty in your life?

If you're anything like me, then it could be because you're in debt. Emotional debt, financial debt, time debt, relationship debt.

Debt is the single most damaging thing to emerge in our modern society, because it not only saps all the resources you have right now, but it also saps resources that you don't even have yet!

James Clear explains it well. Start here with his blog on time debt, and I'll pick up the thread with you in coming days.
